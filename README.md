## 🔮 Vision & Purpose

### 🌐 Vision – The Future of Blockchain Gaming

Our vision is to redefine blockchain gaming through NodeNet Builder—the simplest, most accessible blockchain simulation game available today. We've eliminated technical barriers to create a user-friendly experience where anyone can build and optimize blockchain networks through intuitive puzzles.

### 🎯 Purpose – Learn & Innovate through Gameplay

The game's purpose combines straightforward entertainment with educational value and tangible rewards. Players can experiment with blockchain configurations without technical knowledge, instantly visualize transaction flows, and earn real rewards for successful network designs. NodeNet Builder transforms complex blockchain concepts into engaging gameplay where learning happens naturally—and players are compensated for their achievements through our innovative reward system.

## 🚀 Innovation Highlights

NodeNet Builder introduces several innovations to the blockchain gaming space:

* **Visual Blockchain Simulation:** Real-time visualization of blockchain operations
* **Parameter-Based Puzzles:** Challenges requiring specific optimization approaches
* **Dynamic Test Engine:** Comprehensive performance evaluation across multiple metrics
* **Educational Progression:** Structured learning path through blockchain concepts

## 🧩 Puzzle Progression

No level limits—players stake and choose levels freely. The higher the stake, the more challenging the level, with greater rewards but also increased risks.

1. **Foundation Puzzles:** Learn basic node placement and connections.
2. **Consensus Challenges:** Optimize networks for different consensus mechanisms.
3. **Attack Resistance:** Build networks resilient to blockchain attacks.
4. **Performance Optimization:** Design high-throughput, low-latency networks.
5. **Scaling Scenarios:** Handle growing transaction volumes and changing conditions.

> Levels dynamically evolve based on gameplay. Each challenge simulates a test network with a set of blocks—higher levels introduce more diverse blocks, increased error rates, and unpredictable network conditions.

## 🔑 How Core Chain Works

* **Secure & Transparent** – Blockchain-based validation ensures transparency and real ownership.
* **Low Gas Fees & Fast Transactions** – Optimized for cost-effective and rapid network interactions.
* **Core Token** – The native token used as a reward, enabling players to earn and stake within the game. Players can use Core Token for various in-game activities like staking and unlocking advanced features.
* **Utility NFT Claims** – Daily utility NFT claims are processed on Core Chain for seamless and efficient distribution.

## Conclusion

NodeNet Builder is a simple blockchain simulation puzzle game built on Core Chain. It turns complex blockchain concepts into interactive challenges that are both fun and educational. Designed for accessibility, the game provides an easy entry point for beginners while still offering depth for experienced players. With a functional prototype ready, the project is set for hackathon evaluation and future expansion.
